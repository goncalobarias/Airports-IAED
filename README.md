# Airport Manager (Projects IAED)

The goal was, in the [first part](https://github.com/goncalobarias/Airports-IAED/tree/p1), to construct an airports management system, as such, the system should define the airports, flights and a way to consult them.

In the [second part](https://github.com/goncalobarias/Airports-IAED/tree/main) of the project, the goal was to modify the first part in order to be able to also define bookings for the flights and a way to consult and modify them.

Lastly, in the [workshop test](https://github.com/goncalobarias/Airports-IAED/tree/workshop-test) I extended/added some features to the second part of the project.
